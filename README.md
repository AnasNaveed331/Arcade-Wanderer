## What I Learned 📚
During the development of **Arcade Wanderer**, I explored several key concepts and skills:  
1. **HTML & CSS Fundamentals:**  
   - Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML.  
   - Styling elements using CSS to achieve retro aesthetics (e.g., neon effects, box shadows, gradients).  
2. **JavaScript DOM Manipulation:**  
   - Selecting and updating DOM elements dynamically.  
   - Adding event listeners for interactivity (button clicks to move the snake).  
3. **CSS Grid & Layout Techniques:**  
   - Utilizing CSS Grid for button layout and responsive design.  
   - Positioning elements within a container effectively.
   - Using rem and em for Responsive Design
4. **Boundary Handling:**  
   - Ensuring the Orb remains inside the container by calculating its dimensions relative to the container's borders.  
5. **Debugging and Dynamic Styling:**  
   - Using `window.getComputedStyle()` to access and utilize computed CSS properties programmatically.  
   - Handling numerical calculations in JavaScript with pixel-based units.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **HTML5**: For structuring the game elements.
- **CSS3**: For styling and creating the retro arcade aesthetics.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactivity and game logic.

## Future Enhancements 🚀
Here are a few features I plan to add:
- **Score System**: Track your progress as you play.
- **Food Generation**: Add collectibles to make the game more engaging.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Allow movement using arrow keys.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance responsiveness for touch devices.
